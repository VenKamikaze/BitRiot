Feature:
2022-04-27: Add a player select screen before starting the game.

* Navigate menu with first controller (done)
* action1 button allows navigation of menu buttons (done)
* In player select screen:
** Probably use RmlUi data-model again (done)
** Detect game controller action2 button press and associate it with a player. (NOT DONE)
** Detect action2 key press and associate it with a player (NOT DONE)
** Show portrait for each character (done)
** Allow switching gender/portrait once associated with a player (left/right) (partially done - portrait shows and is toggleable but only by main controller)
** first controller has Up/down navigation to access buttons on this screen (left/right is used for portrait if associated with character)
** allow switching between human/CPU controlled by pressing action2 again. (partially done - CPU/human switching works, but only by main controller)

Bugs:
2022-04-30: No way of assigning controllers to players from the menu yet, so first come first serve when the game starts.
